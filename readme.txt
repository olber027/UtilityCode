search algorithm design:


data structure design:
    LinkedList:
    This is a templated linked list. supports all basic linked list
    operations.

sorting algorithm design:
    There is a static Sort class which contains a number of different
    sorting algorithms, all taking an array (of any simple type) and
    the size of the array as parameters. These algorithms modify the
    given array.
